One of the aspects of vivasayam that is gaining popularity and relevance in the modern world is iyarkai vivasayam, or organic farming. Organic farming is a method of vivasayam that avoids the use of synthetic chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and relies on natural inputs, processes and principles to enhance soil fertility, crop diversity, pest control and animal welfare. Organic farming can reduce environmental pollution, conserve natural resources, increase food quality and safety, and support rural livelihoods.
 
Another aspect of vivasayam that is essential for food security and nutrition is kaalnadai valarppu, or animal husbandry. Animal husbandry is the branch of vivasayam that deals with the care, breeding, feeding and management of domestic animals such as cows, goats, sheep, poultry, pigs, etc. Animal husbandry can provide valuable products such as milk, eggs, meat, wool, leather, etc. as well as services such as draught power, manure, companionship, etc. Animal husbandry can also enhance soil health, crop production and biodiversity through integrated farming systems.
